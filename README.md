# flutter_api

A small project that outputs API data to a table.

## Detailed description

The main language of my program was Dart using the Flutter framework. My program involved three files: main.dart, CCData.dart, CCList.dart.
The basic logic was involved in the CCList.dart file. The _loadCC () function works asynchronously and executes the get request and executes the json parser. The _buildList () function receives input and converts it to model commands.
